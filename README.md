 3.Table header is two-tiered.
 4.Json response is modified to append '%' to Commision column and capitalize first letter for Type column before displaying

 8.Fixed table header while scrolling within the table.
 9.Page redirection to /lenders upon landing on the home page.
 10.Page reload upon clicking on the application logo.

2.Inclusion of ModalModule to achieve a advanced Modal window for Edit table.
3.Better Responsiveness across devices.
4.Adherance to Accessibility guidelines.
